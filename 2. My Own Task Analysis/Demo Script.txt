1. The candy is just red , No flavor . Just  plan and chewy .  I would never buy them again
2. The Strawberry Twizzlers are my guilty pleasure - yummy. Six pounds will be around for a while with my son and I.
3. This oatmeal is not good. Its mushy, soft, I don't like it. Quaker Oats is the way to go.
4. This bag of candy online is pretty expensive, it should be cheaper in order to compete with grocery stores, other than that, its a good combination of my favorite candy
5. No tea flavor at all. Just whole brunch of artifial flavors. It is not returnable. I wasted 20+ bucks.
